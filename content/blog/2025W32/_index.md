## What to do in life?

For quite some time I didn't know how to proceed with life. I'm so stuck that in Now page I put my status as 'Thinking What to do with Life"



I never have a sense of what kind of a job I want to work and the mainstream advice I see on the internet is to - follow your passion. Sacrifice something and pursue my passion and dream. Don
t cope. But I have a problem, I have more than one interest.
I didn't picked my dream major simply because I don't have one. Physics and engineering stands out because I'm pretty good at them. 
So am I doomed? Having many seed sprouding but never have enough water to water them?

Bill Burnett and Dave Evans says differently.


Under design thinking, I would reframe myself as, I have a few interest where I can look for as a source of fulfilment for life.




I want to share a few quotes that helped me to grow new lens:
> False best is the enemy of better

> Unlike a tame problem that is to be solved, life, inherently, is a wicked problem that is to be desgined and what we need is an adaptable flexible approach.
