One of my favorite writer Chip has recently publish an [article](https://huyenchip.com/2024/04/17/personal-growth.html) on a fun way to measure personal growth. By extension of them, three heuristics to optimize personal growth.

TL;DR:
1. Increase rate of change. Chip tries to become a new person every 3-6 years.
2. Solve **big** problems as soon as possible. Chip thought of this as creating a safety nets that allows her to take bigger risks and explore more things.
3. Pick options and actions that maximize future options, opening more doors.

While the heuristics are debatable and applicable to everyone, one thing that made me really resonated with Chip is how I agree with her opinions on *changing*.

> Maybe one day, I’ll get tired of exploration, and these heuristics will change. When that happens, that’ll be growth.


I mentioned earlier in a post that the only constant in life is change, even ourselves, and my sole desire within this short life is to experience life as fully, richly, and abundantly as possible.

I'd definitely like to know more people that I can resonate my dreams with. Chip is one of them.
