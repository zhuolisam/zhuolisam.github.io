I want to share my perspective on life after nearly a year of living independently. Freedom, I've realized, doesn't comes from nothing to do. 

2024 has been the year I truly began living independently. Adulting is hard, but once I gained the ability to support myself, I found freedom—and with it, an abundance of time. This space has allow me to confront questions I'd never considered deeply before. I've spent a lot of time, sitting down alone and started thinking about life. What is life? What should I do with it? These moments of solitude became conversations with myself—thinking, questioning, and writing, all to understand my place in the world.

It occurred to me that, at the very core of my life, there are only two fundamental constraints:

1. Life is short. Everyone has limited time to exist in this world.
2. The only constant we observe in the universe is chaos.

This means anything could happen. Physically, anything bad or good could occur to us at any moment.

In the natural world and the science of biology, chaos manifests as diversity. The richness of diversity of life is what makes the world so beautiful. Think about it: Everyone's thoughts, behaviours, feelings, beliefs are inherently unique. Each person carries a singular set of life experiences, and in the end, that’s all we truly own when it’s time to leave this world.

All I wanted to do with life is simple. We're bounded by time. The only wish I have, is to immerse myself in the vast tapestry of possibilities this reality has to offer, to *feel* and *experience* them myself.

I want to know what emotions feel like—to experience true sadness, happiness, grit and satisfaction. I want to feel the weight of deep sorrow and the clarity that comes with it, to understand the joy of success earned through hard work, and the strength that rises from moments of struggle. I want to know how it feels to live a simple easy life, or to be filled with enthusiasm and driven with passion as I chase my dreams.

I want to experience the full range of sensations. To dive into the deep sea, or to soar through the borderless sky. I want to feel the exhaustion of pushing my body to its limits, and the stillness of deep meditation. I want to know what it’s like to be completely alone, and to feel the warmth of deep connection. 

I want to learn so much about the world and feel how does it feels like to *know*. I want to appreciate the beauty of art and understand the depths of science. 

I simply want to *feel* every possible experiences in this reality. That's the only thing I ever wished for.

All in all, I wish myself to find happiness and peace along this journey, and to always be accompanied by courage, kindness and purity.
