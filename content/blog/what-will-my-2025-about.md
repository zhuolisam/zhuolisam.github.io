I spent most of my 2024 doing thinkings, tinkering with thoughts, figuring out directions.

All the realization brings me clarity, and what I'll need next, is an initial momentum and sustainable system to sail my ship.

Here are a few mindset shift for myself in 2025, to cover what I've lacked this year.

1. Embrace failures & imperfections
	- The cost of failing is often lower than what I think.
	- I should fail more often. Even better, fail intentional.  [Fail at optimal rate](https://www.askell.blog/the-optimal-rate-of-failure/). [Get comfortable with failing](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chloe-shih_lessonslearned-lifelessons-personalgrowth-activity-7269474225579532288-nniw/).
	- More often, failing means [getting feedback quick](https://x.com/dontbesilent12/status/1857825315202187648/?s=12&rw_tt_thread=True), iterate quick, and possibly, get better more quick.
	- Failures are what make the journey enjoyable, and one of the source of opportunity I can learn.
	- With quantity comes quality. [1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chloe-shih_lessonslearned-lifelessons-personalgrowth-activity-7269474225579532288-nniw/).[2](https://x.com/randfish/status/1376614750109450245?t=FGJk8kCt9pMIZTE3Skvhkw)
	- Questions, unknowns, challenges are [opportunities](https://zhuolisam.github.io/blog/shape-of-unknowns/). It signals a gap that I can fill.
	- The key to getting things done is [to limit time spent, or to keep the scope focused and small](https://zhuolisam.github.io/blog/a-new-perspective-on-productivity/).
	- To innovate is to explore, to explore is to fail. So, to be successful to innovate is to be resilient at failures. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqi7mIhgFFc),[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoGmfcsoADI)
	- There are things I cannot control, if imperfections happens, so be it,  and let it be part of myself.
1. Be honest
	- If it doesn't work, accept it, move on, iterate, make it better.
	- Accept it if I failed, because point 1. 
	- Do I really want it? Yes. Then go for it. Ask for it. Chase for it. To [have courage](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4IUK2dPFyJ/) is to realize I have only one life and I should make decision for myself. What am I pursuing if not after what makes me alive?
	- Never be driven by external motivation. Always ask and listen to my heart and mind. Is this what I want? Does it makes me happy? Does it fuel me with energy (带来能量), makes me happy or bring me peace? (I'm pretty intrinsically driven, I'm pretty good at asking myself this)
2. Actions precede motivations
	- Keep the big picture in mind; keep the efforts focused and small.
	- While diversity is more beautiful than monotonic, [simple is better than complex](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/).
	- [Seize opportunities over excessive planning](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html).
	- [Follow not dreams but opportunities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3I3kAg2J7w)
	- [Do what you really care, what fill you with energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elsh6-tcYRA)

In short, 2025 will be the year I'd continue thinking about many interesting topics in life, and, removing time & energy spent into growing uncertain or doubtful thoughts, replacing and filling them by putting in simple actions seizing rising opportunities, around work that fuel energy in me.
