This year, I set out to explore things for my personal interest, delving deeper into CS topics and pursuing projects purely for curiosity, even they don't directly benefit my career or relationships. I was excited at first, before everything turned into self-doubt and frustration, when I find my progress lacking behind and it wasn't up to my expectations. I couldn't enjoy what I'm doing.

I lie on my bed and asked why, where did all the stress and expectations comes from. And it hit me -- I had let my social yearnings hijack my personal yearnings.

I started these projects to satisfy my curiosity, without worrying about practical outcomes. That was my goal. But somewhere along the way, an invisible voice took over. It told me I must learn faster, be more effective, prove my intelligence, and ace jobs interview with the knowledge I acquired. It said I'd embarrass myself in front of family, friends, peoples out there if I fail. They all came from the invisible imaginary social expectations imposed by my social tentacles that I thought were real and from myself.

And in fact, I have been carrying this voice in my head for years, that's why I couldn't enjoy and complete anything that I enjoyed. It's a long overdue realization.

These expectations weren't real. If my friends and families had expectations, I sincerely believe that they only care for one thing -- that I'm enjoying it, I'm becoming better, healthier, happier person from doing whatever I'm doing. That's the only yearnings I believe exists.

Realizing this has helped me silence that critical voice. I hope I'll recover and soon return on my track, doing whatever I wanted to do, with genuine curiosity and free of pressure.
