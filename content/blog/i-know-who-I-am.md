I know who I am.

I know there are multidimensional me living inside my body.

I have curiosity, naivety, kindness, empathy. I also have fears, anxiety, anger, stubborn, obsession. I can feel selfless sometimes, I can be cruel and angry at times. I can be selfless when I'm happy, I hide my sadness whenever things don't happen my way. 

I can easily feel satisfied by small little things in life, and I'm touched listening to sad unfortunate stories.

I'm not the brightest guy nor the most emotionally stable person. There're voices in my head that I have to deal with whenever I'm pursuing something. That's why I'm always a step behind when doing things. Sometimes, I fuck up hard. But there will be voices comforting myself saying I'll be fine. I'm resilient to whatever happens and however I feel. Because I'm good at picking myself up after rains and storms, failures and emotional setbacks .

Sometimes I can be be sensible, logical, sharp and clear, instantly making sense of whatever is happening. People call it being smart. Sometimes I'm overwhelmed by emotions, voices and senses in my head, they take over how I see and how I feel of the world. People call it being emotional.

Iâ€™m drawn by how fascinating the universe, living creatures, intelligence are. And I can easily be influenced and resonate along to music, arts, literature, dances, mother nature. I love learning how everything in universe works. I love learning how brain and body works. I love questioning what happens inside black hole and what does it mean to travel at speed of light. I ask what is reality, time and space and if they can be bend. I ask if there're extraterrestrial life living somewhere in universe.

I love bossa nova jazz, I like indie pop, I love brit rock, I love country folk ballad. I like how k-pop idols dance, I like how skateboarders skate, I like how Olympic fencers fence, I like how rock climbers climb. I love going art exhibition indulging myself in the story, feeling the meaning behind the paintings. I love reading Haruki Murakami. I love taking pictures of stupid little greens when I hike. I love being in the mud and enjoy the mess. I love playing with water and feeling washed. I want to conquer Mount Everest one day and I want to learn paragliding to feel how birds feel.

This is who I am.

Do I like every part about me? Hell no. But I love most part of me. I like who I am, I like the way I feel, I like the way I do things, and I like the pace, with which I learn my mistakes. I don't want to be anybody else, but me.
