I've found out that I have little interest in the 9-5 corporate work I do, but on the other hand, the projects that I have genuine interest, I have too little energy to plan, execute and get them done.

This is a thing I'm allocating more energy, time and effort in 2025.

Everything has a balance. Corporate job is not a place to fulfil our yearnings and define our values. Our personal projects and growth are. That's the place we should devote more time into.
