What is this about? I'm sharing 4 music work that I enjoyed the most, throughout different seasons in 2024.

Why am I writing this? While Spotify Wrapped provide a statistics summarize our music listening records, I believe there're much more beyond just numbers about the music we listen. I want to share why I listened to them.
