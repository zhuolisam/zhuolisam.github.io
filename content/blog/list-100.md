> Before 2025, I only keep a bucket list of like... 10 items. One day I read [Chip's bucket list](https://huyenchip.com/list-100/), it led me to question if I'm asking too little in life, and if I can ask for more.

1. Astrophotography
2. Skateboarding
3. Paragliding
4. Fly an airplane
5. Start a business, own the responsibility to be an owner
6. Calisthenics
7. Visit Mount Everest (Everest Base Camp) 
8. Learn Brazilian Portuguese

(PS. 4. is the whole purpose of my life, meanwhile it's just 1/100 in Chip's list, that [blew my mind](https://x.com/zhsaml/status/1880967251781906900)
