Let's frame this, by learning in tech I mean tangible technical and engineering knowledge and skills to solve a software engineering problem.

Why do I need to learn these engineering skills? To answer why let's zoom out for the bigger picture. What is engineering and why do we engineer?

To me, engineering exists to simply make human's life better. This means solving a problem or making lives convenient. Building houses, designing roads and piping water streams all have the same purpose. So is the software industry.

While technologies are evolving everyday, there are many foundational technology problems peoples long ago had addressed. They built some technologies that addresses them, and because technologies

In a smaller scope -- the field of software engineering, people concluded ways, philosophies, methodologies, patterns, systems that were able to better deliver solutions and address challenges. By better, it can mean more efficient, more convenient, more resource-saving.

Hence, to learn engineering is to learn a craft. It's no different than building a house. Aside from gaining theoretical knowledge, it's also important to actually practice them. Learning in tech is simplified into *practicing* what I *studied* into reality, trying to *make reality better*.

Not all engineering knowledge worth acquiring, but useful ones become assets that help me in the future when I'm solving bigger challenge. 

What are there to learn?
 
Problem. The only thing I'd like to learn is, the Problem. What are the problems we have, what we tried to solved, we actually solved, we're yet to solve? Why is TCP invented? Why is data format invented? Knowing these problems is much more important that knowing the solution. 

This would indirectly shapes how we learn. When we learn new solutions by putting on the lens of trying to understand the actual problem beneath, we'll see rationals, reasons, decision that were made along the way. When we were to reinvent the wheels or to innovate, we understand the essence of problem. 

Solutions. There's simply to much to learn and there will be always things to learn. I don't ask this question anymore. I focus on what values I want to deliver. There can be 10 solutions and 101 tools to pick from. I only care what can the tools do, what it cannot.

Where are the opportunities to learn?
- When we make mistakes and errors.
- When we're unclear of something.


As a rule of thumb, I always see how a piece of knowledge fits in a bigger picture. When I have time to spare, understand a layer of abstraction under it.
