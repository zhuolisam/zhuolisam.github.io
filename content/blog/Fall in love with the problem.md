One thing I found out when I'm building my learning system and knowledge system is we simply don't start with defining our input sources, but rather, the problems and open gaps in reality we like to see it solved. I'm influenced by so many materials that share this idea: [1](https://youtu.be/5kNCcpM61eo), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0nsW3nIFgk), [3](https://benchugg.com/writing/studying-useless-things/), [4](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61131333-fall-in-love-with-the-problem-not-the-solution)

Then the question arise, how big the problem I should care about? I think they can varies.

To tackle something big, it takes decades of learning the domain knowledge and filling curiosity. 

Hence I turn this *drive* of commitment to bring meaningful impact into the real-world, into smaller projects to address the knowledge gaps.

Introductory learning projects, hands-on pet project, experiments, etc. 

The outcome and solution doesn't matters as much from this perspective. The more important question to answer is, is this a gap worth filling?  What are the minimum context and knowledge I need to fill this. How long do I need to do something small until I can make something big? In how long I see myself filling it? Are there other experts working on the problem? What is their solution?

They're much more interesting ideas to be discussed about, more than the nitty gritty I learn during all those daily studies and daily grinds.

The pursuit of knowledge must begins with life and returns to life.
求知始于生活，归于生活。
