Here's the video about it. [I Was An MIT Educated Neurosurgeon Now I'm Unemployed And Alone In The Mountains How Did I Get Here?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25LUF8GmbFU) I encouraged everyone to watch it.


Having tortured by hip pain for over a year, from my experience, sometimes improving my lifestyle and work on the mental aspects, it would helped with the pain a lot. I'm very near with agreeing with this man. It just that sometimes I don't have the enough courage to truly adapt my life, because that is not what every young man out there will do at this age. This is the age that we should run and chase and achieve.

TLDR the neurosurgeon's observation on things people do to heal, that worked:
1. Just let go.
2. Diet. Eat clean.
3. Get enough sleep.
4. Maintain a good social life and connection with people who you love and who love you.

This realization is not an objective nor a rare opinion.

Here's another video by a professional physiotherapist Zac Cupples on gaining a healthy body.
[Can Fixing Posture Improve Breathing? - Zac Cupples, PT | JawCast #22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsuS3G0gzeI)

In the last one third of the video, Zac does not even talks a lot on physio exercises, but working on your life is they key to improve your physical health and mental health.
