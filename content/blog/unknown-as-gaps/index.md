When I was younger, I always found unknowns intimidating. That dark, empty, formless territory filled me with anxiety when I think of them.

Not long ago, I learned to reframe the unknown by giving it a *shape*, quite literally. Now, I see unknown and unanswered questions as gaps in my mental model. They signal new opportunities to complete, enrich and expand my mental model. 

Recognizing and marking these gaps makes them feel less daunting, bringing clarity to my mind.
