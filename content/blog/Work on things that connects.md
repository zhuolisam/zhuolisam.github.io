[Luke Farritor: Husker wins grand prize for global Vesuvius Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpflT8XuSyg)

Luke Farritor, a senior student at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, decoded a passage of text from an ancient scroll using AI. 

In the interview, he shared about his motivation:

> 'So I've always been interested in history. Growing up, I learned Latin. I was never that good at it, but I was always kind of into that sort of stuff. Read a lot about the Roman Empire and things.'

After bookmarking it, I pushed it to the back of my mind. But during my evening stroll, while reflecting on some pain points that I'm facing, I get new ideas and inspirations from Luke's story.

There are many branches and topics in CS, sparked huge curiosity in me, and I want to learn tiny bit of them as much as I could. Distributed system, concurrent programming, NLP, LLMs, and recently AI Agents, are some examples.

As I delved deeper studying them, I’d eventually find myself going in circles, not learning anything concrete. I spent some time reading about AI agents, yet when I tried to build one, I don't actually know what should I build. The excitement of learning fizzled into frustration.

Turns out maybe curiosity alone isn’t enough. It seems it needs something to complement it.

I asked, is there something that this technology can *connect* to me? Like how they connect to Luke's childhood interests? Maybe it doesn't need to connect to my interest, but other past experiences that I have.

I did find some answers. 

Luke's story brought up a new mindset. Learning something because it looks cool is a fine starting point, to learn and work on something because it connects with a part of me is much more powerful. 

I talked about it to ChatGPTand got roasted. The idea that learning is more meaningful when it connects to personal experiences, is obvious. It's a realization that should happened years ago.  but I had to learn it after I really face my frustrations that have been around for years.

Then, can we *manufacture* connection rather than waiting for a link to appear? Or to force a weak and a far-fetched connection to draw motivation? I have no clue.

PS.

A small note, Luke also mentioned his education contributed to his achievement.
> 'The University of Nebraska does a really good job of encouraging their students to think boldly. And I think that's played a pivotal role in my work on this project.'
