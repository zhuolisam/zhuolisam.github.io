Upskilling ourselves in tech is essential. In the past, I found myself overwhelmed by the endless sea of MOOCs, e-books and tutorials. Technology is such a vast field that without focus, learning can feel directionless.

### Wearing a purpose lens
I discovered that having a clear purpose fuels the learning process. Before diving into any broad field, it's crucial to wear a purpose lens and ask: What does the field itself *mean* to me? What *value* does this knowledge bring to me?

For me, technology and engineering are more than just science—they’re about enhancing human life. One thing I envision technology to help, is to _enable_ better human-information interaction.

In a more practical sense, I learn tech to help solve problems—for users, my team, and ultimately my company. By helping users, I help my boss, my team, and my organization succeed.

Lastly, tech is just cool and fun! It’s exciting to explore things that didn’t exist a decade ago and see how they improve our lives.

#### Applying the Purpose Lens
With this clarity, I can now choose what to learn:

1. First, to enable efficient human-information interaction.

To achieve this is actually to ask: How do human process information and store information? During the past 6 months I've been studying how brain works and I find them very interesting. This purpose-driven approach makes me figure out sometimes it's not even about the knowledge in tech that matters the most anymore. I should start learning adjacent domain field where the problem I'm interested lies within. Even with that, I still have a very clear sense of how technology fits in the big picture, and which exact fraction of technology I should learn.

2. To help contribute to company success.

To help my team and company grow, I'm focusing on learning things that would bring real impact. It means seeking better solution, help speeding up existing workflow, improving team productivity, scaling services and ensuring services uptime, saving cost, .etc. 

For example: 
- How to write cleaner and more maintainable code? 
- Can the latest open source library X improve our current solution? 
- How can I identify opportunities to save infrastructure cost? 
- What is a good enough strategy to scale services to handle users traffic efficiently? 
- How can I scale team productivity? 

The fundamentals of software engineering and those questions that get asked during are important, but I find these questions much more interesting and fulfiling. They keep my curiosity and the drive to learn alive.


3. Lastly, explore for fun!
   
I often feel excited. I find myself constantly drawn to cool tech facts and breakthroughs. It's so crazy to think learn about the fact there's so much things that weren't available 10 years ago that are available today. Computers helped change our lives so much. 

They usually comes in form of news and facts, and I find myself drawn to these random facts, start researching, digging and learning bottom up about the concepts related to the fact. 

For instance: The [largest known prime number](https://www.mersenne.org/#:~:text=2136279841%2D1%20is%20the,GIMPS%20nearly%206%20years%20ago.) is over 16 million digits long was found October 2024, which the underlying compute power were a large distributed GPUs network crowdsourced by spanning 17 countries. That makes me wonder how does it work, and I drill down the rabbit hole.

By wearing a purpose lens, I've found direction in the vast world of tech. Purpose makes learning meaningful, focused, and most importantly, enjoyable.
