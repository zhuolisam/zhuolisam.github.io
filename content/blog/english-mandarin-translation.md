I realized, quite a lot of Mandarin words, phrases, ideology cannot be translated into English. For instance: `毁三观`. There's no words in English that can represents `三观`, argubly the closest we might say is `ones' worldview` + `one's values of worth`, `one's moral values`. But they're all not precise, since `values` can mean so many things.
