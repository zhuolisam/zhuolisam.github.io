Rewatching La La Land at the critical time in my life.

I first watched La La Land when I was 15 at 2016 when it came out. I always enjoyed it as a musical film.

It's Friday night, I didn't want to think about questions behind my mind, it was pretty random I decided to revisit La La Land. 7 years later rewatching it, as I'm adulting and dealing with adult life, I was finally able to relate how Seb and Mia feel, chasing their dream.

 > City of stars, <br>
 > There's so much that I can't see

 > Who knows? <br>
 > Is this the start of something wonderful and new? <br>
 > Or one more dream that I cannot make true?

I won't talk about any preach nor share any gains, it's subjective to your experience. I just want to jot down what I might have realize from the movie hour tonight, as a note to myself.

1. Perception grows with experience. <br>
Experience life, you'll be able to relate and resonate with more.

2. It's normal to feel not heading anywhere. <br>
Complete what you have to do, then you can spend time with what you _like to do_.

3. A little bit of madness is key.

In the end it all boils down to life. <br>
You'll have your way to experience your own life. <br>
Learn to live a life. Learn to love life. Learn to _live life_. Then you're be fine :) <br>
Other prospects are just bullshit. <br>
