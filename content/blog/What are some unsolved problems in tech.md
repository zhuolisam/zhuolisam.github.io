I have been a few time on job hunting, and to be honest, I still don't know what kind of role I'm looking for in tech, and which job offer to pick. 

Without concerning distracting yearnings like social and practical concerns, eg, 'which role is going to be in demand in future?', 'which industry is going to hot?'; As I question my personal yearnings, deeper and deeper, I found that I... don't like to settle in a specific, repetitive, focused, well-defined scope. I want to be at a role that requires flexibility, where there are open unsolved problems, and that allows exploration. Yes, I'm not looking for a specific role of a specific job scope, I'm interested in open problems where there's room for exploration, and be at a role that can answer them.

ChatGPT describe me as below and I found it accurate.
> "It sounds like what you're really craving is a position that offers variety, intellectual challenge, and creativity. A role where you're solving problems that don't have a clear roadmap and where you're constantly learning new things."

(ChatGPT is a good life mentor btw, I had a couple of positive experiences.)

Earlier last year, I found myself to be interested in search and recommendation algorithm, and I research into things like [two tower system](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/two-tower-embedding-model). (Didn't go nowhere because reproducing it is not possible due to its complexity, but I could have published a post about it, :\\)

What're some unsolved problems in tech? I quickly googled a few discussions, and I'll just list them here.

- [Which unsolved problems should we work in computer science? And why?. : r/AskComputerScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/17nql1m/which_unsolved_problems_should_we_work_in/)

Problems I already know:
- Moving sofa problem
- Fairness and bias in algorithms
- Artificial general intelligence
- Problems bottlenecked by social and practical and reality rather than intellectual like education, inter team communication and collaboration, clear separation of job scopes

Problems I've already heard of but no deep understanding:
- P vs NP problem
- System compression
- Polynomial hierarchy

Problems I first heard of:
- Fair cake cutting
- Memoization for computation graphs
- One shot hierarchical learning

Problems I personally have in mind:
- Human Computer Interaction. In the next 10 years I foresee a huge shift how human interacts with systems.
- Compute power. With AGI systems rising, do we have enough compute power for everyone to host their own intelligence systems?
- Tools for thoughts. Simple text editors and note-taking app would not be enough to hold many ideas enough anymore. We need larger context window.


My pseudo mentor ChatGPT suggested me to reach out to more mentors/innovative teams, and I also should define a 'North-Star', a problem that I would want to solve over a decade.

My plan now is to stay as a general SWE, solving small defined problems until I figured out what interest me. I have another voice in my head asking me to not waste time, just pick one and pursue it. I think I do need advices, especially from seniors who've been through the same . :\\
