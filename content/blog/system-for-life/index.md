I realized I want to take account of my life, having [found a sense of purpose](https://zhuolisam.github.io/blog/my-perspective-of-life/). I want to create a simple framework, that breaks my life into manageable pieces, so I can focus on *maxxing* out *my experiences*.

Here is a prototype.

I think of humans as closed systems, inspired by a model by [Leslie](https://justgoidea.com/posts/2023-049/#%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E6%98%AF-lifeos). We consume energy, process it, and produce it. To sustain our lives, we rely on interconnected systems.

I‚Äôve also envisioned a framework I call the üèõÔ∏è _pillars of life_, based on [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). I imagine these pillars as towering structures, with islands on it representing different aspects of myself. On these islands, I build systems designed to be self-sustaining. A little plane, representing our sense of self, I navigate between these islands, steadily climbing higher and higher. Ultimately, it moves toward the top of the pillars, where my dreams reside and where my pursuit realizes.

For a pillar to grow, it needs a system and nutrients, as described in *human as closed system*. For instance, to grow our wealth means to allocate *time* on gaining related *knowledge*, develop accurate mental models of efficient money *strategies*, making the correct *decision*, placing the correct *focus* and *energy* to get actual work done.

Finally, all of these happens in the flow of time, and that's the reason why I started ‚úçÔ∏è *journalling* more this year ‚Äî to capture each moment and make them truly live on. I document what I think, how I feel, and the sensations I experience in those slices of time.
