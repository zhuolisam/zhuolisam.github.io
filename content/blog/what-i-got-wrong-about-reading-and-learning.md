I was kinda struck by the fact that everything I'e learned and read in the past 5 years did not helped me.

I thought what I needed was a personal knowledge management system(PKM). So I started looking into all the frameworks and tools around PKM. PARA, CODE, Progressive Summarization, Obsidian. (Yep I'm THAT Obsidian guy)

While I developed my own reading and learning workflow, trying my best to internalize the knowledge, something still isn't feel right. When I can't consult the notes stored in my knowledge, ie. when I'm doing bare thinking, I couldn't recruit those knowledge that I previously read and took notes.

What's the big deal?

Yea it's not a big deal for informational knowledge like "What are the steps for prime factorization?", "How do LSM Tree in databases works internally?"

But it matters when we're at some major points of our lives. When we're hesitating making a decision, when we felt lost, when we we feel stagnant, when we feel sad and emotional. 

We watch, read, take notes of tons of these motivational speeches. Do them helped me when I was at such points?

Not really.
