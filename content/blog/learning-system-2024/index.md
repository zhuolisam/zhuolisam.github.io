Why am I writing this? I've faced a huge problem with the information I've read and studied, they don't stick. Either I can't find them when I need to, or I totally forgot that I've read something helpful before. Trying to solve this is a century hard problem (for me).

Before the system, a few premise that I'd like to share.

To me, the flow of information is simple:

We capture information and inspiration, we process and internalize information into our knowledge, we utilize and do something with the knowledge we have. 

In this article, I define *knowledge* as what I've *internalized* in my brain.

I want to share how I design and architect my learning system. Some baseline constraint of this system: 
1. It must be simple, simply because I'm lazy.
2. Retrieval of knowledge must be efficient, because I don't know where did I place something.



### Cycle of knowledge





### System to adapt to the cycle of knowledge
