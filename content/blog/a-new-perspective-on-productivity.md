I've always think of productivity as getting more things done. I'm so sold by those productivity videos on social media, where people are showing the side that they fill all the time in their day, and able to get so much projects and work done. I thought that by filling all of my available time on work, results will yield.

I was wrong.

From the math perspective, the formula of productivity is simply result over time.

$$Productivity = \frac{Result}{Time}$$

To increase productivity, we have to be able to measure it, and the first step to measure, is to limit the time spent. At work, at tasks, at projects.

There'll never be an end to all the tasks we have at work, the projects we wanted to complete. I always have so many projects idea in my mind, but I never get them done, nor I ever feel productive when I finally start to work on them. The project features gets bigger bigger 

Turns out the key to completing more is simple: just set a deadline.

This aligns with the observation of [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law). 

> work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

By limiting time, we remove unnecessary and redundant actions getting in our way from completing a project before the deadline. For me, that includes overthinking and bloating the features in the project.
