I've always think of productivity as getting more things done. I'm so sold by those productivity videos on social media, where people are showing the side that they fill all the time slots in their day, and they were able to get so much work and projects done. I thought that by filling all of my available time on work, results will yield.

I was wrong.

From the math perspective, the formula of productivity is simply result over time.

{{< katex >}}
$$
Productivity = \frac{Result}{Time}
$$

To increase *Productivity* in the formula, we have to be able to measure by controlling the variables. The first step to measure *Productivity*, is to limit the time spent. At work, at tasks, at projects.

There'll never be an end to all the tasks we have at work, the projects we wanted to complete. I always have so many projects idea in my mind, but I never get them done, nor I ever feel productive when I finally start to work on them. The project features gets bigger in head, until the motivation depletes.

Turns out the first step to completing more is simple: set a deadline.

This aligns with the statement in [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law). 

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

By limiting time, we remove unnecessary work and distractions getting in our way from completing a project before the deadline. For me, that includes overthinking and bloating the target outcome in the project.

Every effort counts. No matter how small, whatever experimental knowledge, novel insights, practical experiences we gained in previous work turns into foundation ready to be transferred into use in our next project. We incrementally raise the target outcome in next iteration, pushing what we able to product and achieve in the next project, bits by bits. That's how productivity increases. Incremental result produced within the same timeframe.

Another way I look at increasing productivity in the formula, is to get a focused and small scoped result under increasingly shorter time. I think this applies when we're at a context familiarising ourselves in particular environment, crafting a precise actions skill, or to consolidate and retain existing knowledge chunks.


I realized this simple perspective but have yet to complete any significant projects. I plan to revisit it in the future to see how the idea holds up.
