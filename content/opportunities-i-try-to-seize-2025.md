With conjunction with my goals of 2025, the theme of the year is to seize opportunities, make actions more than thinking. So I'm keeping a list of the opportunities, and I'll review them at the from quarter to quarter.

1. Learn Distributed System. (~12mo) 
	1. Including system design, compare and contrast different solution and tool, understand-digest-share case studies.
	2. practical projects. consensus algorithm, distributed kv store, distributed job scheduler, chat system, CRDTs.
2. Open source contribution. (~6mo)
3. An backend engineer role at Ryt Bank



I'm also inspired by keeping a [Failure Resume](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume). I believe these would be the opportunity I would add if they failed. I definitely hope not, and I believe they wouldn't!
