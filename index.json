There were a lot of different answers when I tried to look up people\u0026rsquo;s answer on Reddit and Quora. The most common answer I see is that people sees internet as a huge library and source of knowledge they can soak up. It is a source of information.\nTo me, I always see internet as a new world and a different physical space, that people turn into a different version of themself. That\u0026rsquo;s how people are using internet nowadays, which I\u0026rsquo;m not denying its value, nor I\u0026rsquo;m saying it\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, but is that the true value of the internet?\nWhen I rethink about it, to me, internet space supposed to be no different from what we do and who we are in real life. The point of internet is just to connect. It\u0026rsquo;s a medium that helps us share our daily stories, spontaneous ideas or just any interesting thoughts we have with people that we want to share with. It is simply our daily social network that happens to surpass the physical time-space constraint.\nComing around this, I would also say, the true value of internet are realized only when we start focus around its true value, and start building platforms that can connect people. At least for me.\n","date":"2024-05-18","permalink":"/blog/what-does-the-internet-mean-to-me/","section":"Blog","summary":"What does the internet really mean to me?","title":"What Does The Internet Mean To Me?"},{"content":"My golden dream when I was in highschool, was to hustle hard, get a work in a leading tech/eng organization, like Boeing or Airbus, working on one-of-a-kind problem, designing new cutting-edge solutions that would change the world and push humanity\u0026rsquo;s technology forward.\nBut why would I have such dream? To be honest, do I really want to achieve it? Do I have such yearn only because it sounds cool, or only to satisfy the vanity in my own imaginary world?\nA good question to ask to validate is:\nIf you have tons of money and were just told to enjoy the rest of your life, would you still gonna hustle and to achieve the career goal you set?\nNgl. That hit me hard.\nI guess I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work that hard, but there\u0026rsquo;s one thing for sure, I would still have the raw and pure curiosity, over all the things in the world that feels so magical to me. How tf did the rockets able to fly to the moon? How did the engineers design better aircrafts wings? How did we launched a satelite that is capable of taking a picture of the black hole? Humanity\u0026rsquo;s technology is just so fascinating. I want to know. Knowing how things works fixes my thirst.\nI definitely understand things that I currently care, is because I have experienced it myself. They somehow excite and trigger the curiosity in me. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if I would start to be interested in other things in the future. Someone could share some piece of random piece of knowledge and I would start jumping down the rabbit hole. In fact, large portion of my interest in CS is inspired by amazing friends around me, things like Linux and Computer Networking, their existence just left me feel fascinated.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a toxic trait in me. Once I know how a thing work, I never bother building or creating a solution out of it. It\u0026rsquo;s strange I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in solving unsolved problem, I\u0026rsquo;m just curious how current things work. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s just how I am.\nBut if one is really thirsty, move on, being curious is not enough. Stop trying to understand it and really understand it. The best way to understand it is to build it.\n","date":"2024-05-17","permalink":"/blog/what-drives-me-in-life/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"What Drives Me in Life?"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s strange how my answer changed after writing the last post, as if it motivates me to really question myself, do you really want that? It makes me think harder, and ask myself again. Frankly, my answers do change abit.\nif I have tons of money today at this moment, what would I do? I think I\u0026rsquo;d probably pick up new languages, like Japenese which I abandon long time ago.\nIf I have tons of money today at this moment, what would I do? I probably grab a camera and start capturing images of edges and corners on this world that I thought was memorable.\nIf I have tons of money today at this moment, what would I do? I probably start self-learning astrophysics, although knowing that I could never keep up with all the previous knowledge, I\u0026rsquo;d still be happy to share what I know with people around me.\nDo I really want to chase knowing every bits of knowledge in this know universe? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Do I really care working at a big tech company and achieve something big? I couldn\u0026rsquo;t know either.\nCould my profession - computer science fit in the picture? Maybe. Who knows? I don\u0026rsquo;t really care, it\u0026rsquo;s just tool that I picked up somewhere ago, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect my journey.\n","date":"2024-05-17","permalink":"/blog/what-drives-me-in-life-2/","section":"Blog","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s strange how my answer changed after writing the last post, as if it motivates me to really question myself, do you really want that?","title":"What Drives Me in Life? Part 2"},{"content":"I consider myself to be lucky I\u0026rsquo;m who I\u0026rsquo;m today. I was lucky to have parents who provided me considerable good amount of exposure to a lot of things. Music, I was picked up violin since I was young. Even I don\u0026rsquo;t play it nowadays, I learn to appreciate these music pieces beautifully crafted by our ancestors 200. Books. My dad reads a lot of books, and we have a big shelf of books, the ones I enjoyed the most back I was a kid, was the dinasour encyclopedia that has a lot of realistic graphics. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to receive pretty good education, there were good teachers who sparked my interest in physics and mathematics. I enjoyed the physics lab a lot. Interest. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to have an awesome childhood friend, who argubably is the one who sparked a lot of my today\u0026rsquo;s interest and person who affected me the most. We watched animes, we watched gundams, we build gunplas, we exchanged drawings, we played PS2 games, we built Legos, everything together. He got me into anime, science, space, structure, curiousity, creative works. I were once a really creative person back then, even I sucked at drawings class, I liked structures a lot.\nAs time goes by, I grow older and parted with my friends, I started to lose sense of what I really enjoyed deep down in my heart. I really liked physics engineering that I was supposed to study aeronatics, but I ended up studying computer science, when the pandemic hits, that makes me realize CS is probably a better way out. I really appreciate studying CS, and I never regretted it. It opens up a whole new perspetive for me of viewing the world, and how techs has no limits and how it significantly improved human\u0026rsquo;s lives.\nI\u0026rsquo;m lucky that I have a pretty good brain and I can memorize, reason, excels at academic. But overall these years, it seemed that I have limited experiences dealing with failure, and my only mechanism to deal with it is to avoid it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;re so many things that I have experiences, some natural instinct that I was born with, and the things that I have learnt during my uni years, but they\u0026rsquo;re here and there and they never really get connected in my brain, nor are they connected them with the coding skills I have. I want to really live out my life. I want to know where are my boundaries. I want to know how would I look like if I maxed out myself, in pursuing the things I\u0026rsquo;m curious.\nStarting today, I want to connect thougths, ideas, interest in my brain, by realizing them through the medium I have. I loved music and arts so much, I enjoyed crafting concrete artworks, I was so curious about how the universe works, I was so hyped about sci-fi world. I want to find the child in me, who\u0026rsquo;s curious, creative, fearless, I want to be the person again.\n","date":"2024-05-16","permalink":"/blog/reflection/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"A Checkpoint Reflection"},{"content":"","date":"2024-05-16","permalink":"/tags/reflection/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Reflection"},{"content":" Now page changes with time and priorities.
