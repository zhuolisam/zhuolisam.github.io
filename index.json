To be honest, do I really want to achieve it? Do I have such yearn only because it sounds cool, or only to satisfy the vanity in my own imaginary world?\nA good question to ask to validate is:\nIf you have tons of money and were just told to enjoy the rest of your life, would you still gonna hustle and to achieve the career goal you set?\nNgl. That hit me hard.\nI guess I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work that hard, but there\u0026rsquo;s one thing for sure, I would still have the raw and pure curiosity, over all the things in the world that feels so magical to me. How tf did the rockets able to fly to the moon? How did the engineers design better aircrafts wings? How did we launched a satelite that is capable of taking a picture of the black hole? Humanity\u0026rsquo;s technology is just so fascinating. I want to know. Knowing how things works fixes my thirst.\nI definitely understand things that I currently care, is because I have experienced it myself. They somehow excite and trigger the curiosity in me. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if I would start to be interested in other things in the future. Someone could share some piece of random piece of knowledge and I would start jumping down the rabbit hole. In fact, large portion of my interest in CS is inspired by amazing friends around me, things like Linux and Computer Networking, their existence just left me feel fascinated.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a toxic trait in me. Once I know how a thing work, I never bother building or creating a solution out of it. It\u0026rsquo;s strange I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in solving unsolved problem, I\u0026rsquo;m just curious how current things work. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s just how I am.\nBut if one is really thirsty, move on, being curious is not enough. Stop trying to understand it and really understand it. The best way to understand it is to build it.\n","date":"2024-05-17","permalink":"/blog/what-drives-me-in-life/","section":"Blog","summary":"\u003ch4 class=\"relative group\"\u003e \n    \u003cdiv id=\"heading\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#heading\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h4\u003e","title":"What Drives Me in Life?"},{"content":" # I consider myself to be lucky I\u0026rsquo;m who I\u0026rsquo;m today. I was lucky to have parents who provided me considerable good amount of exposure to a lot of things. Music, I was picked up violin since I was young. Even I don\u0026rsquo;t play it nowadays, I learn to appreciate these music pieces beautifully crafted by our ancestors 200. Books. My dad reads a lot of books, and we have a big shelf of books, the ones I enjoyed the most back I was a kid, was the dinasour encyclopedia that has a lot of realistic graphics. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to receive pretty good education, there were good teachers who sparked my interest in physics and mathematics. I enjoyed the physics lab a lot. Interest. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to have an awesome childhood friend, who argubably is the one who sparked a lot of my today\u0026rsquo;s interest and person who affected me the most. We watched animes, we watched gundams, we build gunplas, we exchanged drawings, we played PS2 games, we built Legos, everything together. He got me into anime, science, space, structure, curiousity, creative works. I were once a really creative person back then, even I sucked at drawings class, I liked structures a lot.\nAs time goes by, I grow older and parted with my friends, I started to lose sense of what I really enjoyed deep down in my heart. I really liked physics engineering that I was supposed to study aeronatics, but I ended up studying computer science, when the pandemic hits, that makes me realize CS is probably a better way out. I really appreciate studying CS, and I never regretted it. It opens up a whole new perspetive for me of viewing the world, and how techs has no limits and how it significantly improved human\u0026rsquo;s lives.\nI\u0026rsquo;m lucky that I have a pretty good brain and I can memorize, reason, excels at academic. But overall these years, it seemed that I have limited experiences dealing with failure, and my only mechanism to deal with it is to avoid it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;re so many things that I have experiences, some natural instinct that I was born with, and the things that I have learnt during my uni years, but they\u0026rsquo;re here and there and they never really get connected in my brain, nor are they connected them with the coding skills I have. I want to really live out my life. I want to know where are my boundaries. I want to know how would I look like if I maxed out myself, in pursuing the things I\u0026rsquo;m curious.\nStarting today, I want to connect thougths, ideas, interest in my brain, by realizing them through the medium I have. I loved music and arts so much, I enjoyed crafting concrete artworks, I was so curious about how the universe works, I was so hyped about sci-fi world. I want to find the child in me, who\u0026rsquo;s curious, creative, fearless, I want to be the person again.\n","date":"2024-05-16","permalink":"/blog/reflection/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"A Checkpoint Reflection"},{"content":"","date":"2024-05-16","permalink":"/tags/reflection/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Reflection"},{"content":" Now page changes with time and priorities.
