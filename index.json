In the past, I found myself overwhelmed by the endless sea of MOOCs, e-books and tutorials. Technology is such a vast field that without focus, learning can feel directionless.\nWearing a purpose lens # I discovered that having a clear purpose fuels the learning process. Before diving into any broad field, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to wear a purpose lens and ask: What does the field itself mean to me? What value does this knowledge bring to me?\nFor me, technology and engineering are more than just science—they’re about enhancing human life. One thing I envision technology to help, is to enable better human-information interaction.\nIn a more practical sense, I learn tech to help solve problems—for users, my team, and ultimately my company. By helping users, I help my boss, my team, and my organization succeed.\nLastly, tech is just cool and fun! It’s exciting to explore things that didn’t exist a decade ago and see how they improve our lives.\nApplying the Purpose Lens # With this clarity, I can now choose what to learn:\nFirst, to enable efficient human-information interaction. To achieve this is actually to ask: How do human process information and store information? During the past 6 months I\u0026rsquo;ve been studying how brain works and I find them very interesting. This purpose-driven approach makes me figure out sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not even about the knowledge in tech that matters the most anymore. I should start learning adjacent domain field where the problem I\u0026rsquo;m interested lies within. Even with that, I still have a very clear sense of how technology fits in the big picture, and which exact fraction of technology I should learn.\nTo help contribute to company success. To help my team and company grow, I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on learning things that would bring real impact. It means seeking better solution, help speeding up existing workflow, improving team productivity, scaling services and ensuring services uptime, saving cost, .etc.\nFor example:\nHow to write cleaner and more maintainable code? Can the latest open source library X improve our current solution? How can I identify opportunities to save infrastructure cost? What is a good enough strategy to scale services to handle users traffic efficiently? How can I scale team productivity? The fundamentals of software engineering and those questions that get asked during are important, but I find these questions much more interesting and fulfiling. They keep my curiosity and the drive to learn alive.\nLastly, explore for fun! I often feel excited. I find myself constantly drawn to cool tech facts and breakthroughs. It\u0026rsquo;s so crazy to think learn about the fact there\u0026rsquo;s so much things that weren\u0026rsquo;t available 10 years ago that are available today. Computers helped change our lives so much.\nThey usually comes in form of news and facts, and I find myself drawn to these random facts, start researching, digging and learning bottom up about the concepts related to the fact.\nFor instance: The largest known prime number is over 16 million digits long was found October 2024, which the underlying compute power were a large distributed GPUs network crowdsourced by spanning 17 countries. That makes me wonder how does it work, and I drill down the rabbit hole.\nBy wearing a purpose lens, I\u0026rsquo;ve found direction in the vast world of tech.

I thought that by filling all of my available time on work, results will yield.\nI was wrong.\nFrom the math perspective, the formula of productivity is simply result over time.\n$$ Productivity = \\frac{Result}{Time} $$\nTo increase Productivity in the formula, we have to be able to measure by controlling the variables.

For me, that includes overthinking and bloating the target outcome in the project.\nEvery effort counts. No matter how small, whatever experimental knowledge, novel insights, practical experiences we gained in previous work turns into foundation ready to be transferred into use in our next project. We incrementally raise the target outcome in next iteration, pushing what we able to product and achieve in the next project, bits by bits. That\u0026rsquo;s how productivity increases. Incremental result produced within the same timeframe.\nAnother way I look at increasing productivity in the formula, is to get a focused and small scoped result under increasingly shorter time. I think this applies when we\u0026rsquo;re at a context familiarising ourselves in particular environment, crafting a precise actions skill, or to consolidate and retain existing knowledge chunks.\nI realized this simple perspective but have yet to complete any significant projects.

To have courage is to realize I have only one life and I should make decision for myself. What am I pursuing if not after what makes me alive? Never be driven by external motivation.

However, my mom thinks differently, she believes that it\u0026rsquo;s a manner to make sure if I were to taste something new, everyone should taste them too, else just don\u0026rsquo;t order it.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t understand why because it could potentially waste food, but the key is not to understand, nor to make the best decision, nor to defend my suggestion. There\u0026rsquo;s no best decision in fact. It\u0026rsquo;s always about tolerating and taking a step back. If I don\u0026rsquo;t order it, I just loses the experience. If I ordered more than what we can eat, we\u0026rsquo;ll probably just laugh it off, or just takeaway the rest. Why wasting time debating with my mom on the most logic decision? Also, since it\u0026rsquo;s with my relatives, inheriting Hokkien and traditional Chinese mindset to respecting the elders\u0026rsquo;s mindset just make everyone happy in the end of the day.\nI was stupid and stubborn, I didn\u0026rsquo;t realized. Don\u0026rsquo;t think logically too much, just enjoy the time and make life easier.\n","date":"2024-07-23","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/virtues-differences/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Dealing with Generational Virtues Differences","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"2024-07-23","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/family/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Family","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-06-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music","type":"tags"},{"content":"Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 is undoubtedly a beautifully written piece. All three movements carry such pure emotion that they can draw out the kindness in any person. The second movement is especially well-known; you probably hear it elsewhere. I have listened to them repeatedly throughout the entire month. While walking home from work and feeling bored, I began to imagine and visualize the story behind the second movement, picturing the scene Rachmaninoff was depicting in my mind. I swear, visualizing the story of a piece is the most fun part about classical music.\nSo here is what I heard:\nLong ago, one afternoon, there were two lovers who fell in love at first sight. They were happily dating each other, walking down a river. One day, they had to separate for some reason, and it would be a very long time before they can meet again. The man faced a significant setback, and they couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet with each other. They promised to meet at the place where they first fell in love, after ten years later.\nMany years passed, and both endured numerous hardships, but the time has finally come. They know each other will keep the promise. The day has come, they promise to meet at the bridge they first met. The place were crowded, and they desperately searched for each other through the throng. The woman glimpsed the man but lost sight of him in the sea of people. She pushed her way through the crowd, almost stumbling. As she emerged from the throng, her eyes locked with his. A second felt like a hundred years.\nThey met, but both knew it was a brief reunion. After many years, they had their own stables lives now. The man had to leave before sunset. They hoped time would freeze at that moment, and they can look at each other for longer, for hundred years, for eternity.\nInterestingly, the image I envisioned resembled the final scene of the film Brief Encounter, where the characters break up and part ways. In fact the second movement was chosen as the background music ( Here\u0026rsquo;s a YouTube video of it). This would probably be the story of the two lovers. Unlike Rach\u0026rsquo;s Piano Concerto No.3, this piece has some magical quality that irresistibly draws you in. By the time you realize it, you\u0026rsquo;re already deeply touched by the melody.\n","date":"2024-06-14","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/rachmaninoff-piano-concerto-2/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.2 Op.18","type":"blog"},{"content":"I feel like I should revisit my learning strategy today.\nTo be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of the idea of losing behind, during my unversity. Seeing different people shining in different prospects, I was kind of intimidated where am I heading.\nWow he built a startup, should I build one too? Wow he\u0026rsquo;s building React Native app, shall I learn to build mobile apps too? Wow, he\u0026rsquo;s published a machine learnin paper, is ML the next big thing?\nWhat a loss. Instead of spending time worry what to do, I should\u0026rsquo;ve just do it already.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll say I\u0026rsquo;m blessed with whatever I have now, education I had, science and arts interests I fostered, cultural practices I\u0026rsquo;m exposed to, did some debating for some time as well, life experiences I had are not the best nor the worst. I\u0026rsquo;m just a simple boy who wants to have fun. I explore so many things looking back, and all of them contribute to who I am today. Learning was tough\u0026hellip; but pretty fun back then back in secondary schools!\nDue to many reasons, I think I actually lose that good experience learning from a good environment back when I\u0026rsquo;m a kid. College and University has so many aspects that I started to experience life differently, I\u0026rsquo;m exposed to different peoples who has different values and priorities, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of affected, having a good learning experiences slowly fades out of sight. Maybe, I\u0026rsquo;m not really good with social life. Welp not too late to find out what suites myself more. After all, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to find out I want to pick my abilities back up. Let me have fun in my own way!\nLuckily, internet has made peers and teachers more accesible ever, and today\u0026rsquo;s tech has given me more feasible solution to my concerns and help me to feel like my teen ages again. Here are some of my thoughts that I\u0026rsquo;ll try to implement myself to slowly regain my learning abilites:\nBe brave and have growth mindset. Just ask whatver questions you had. Just connect to people who has the answer to share. Remember when you never afraid to ask physics theory to your physics teacher? Yup. Nobody gonna care about you anyways.\nWrite. Secondary school was the phase where I write the most, and where my mind was the clearest lol. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure is there a relation , but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write more, content that varies in format, shapes, length, prospects. Inspired again by Ben.\nSustainable learning strategy. I can\u0026rsquo;t learn anything at once, the plan is to have a sustainable plan. What to learn? Just pick any topics that is nearer to myself. How should I learn? Read more. Practice more. How to verify I learn? Build and share.\nIngestion pipeline? So many resources to read from. We have tech articles, hands-on tutorial, conceptual videos, curated review article that is already distilled, someone else\u0026rsquo;s notes\u0026hellip;etc. Keep them in stash, label them with tags. Grab when I need. Focus on writing and generating understandings from them instead.\nHaving a healthy body and mind. A aspect that I turned my eyes away for years and treated myself badly. Never get enough sleeps and sports. I should really change that.\nAs of the time writing, I\u0026rsquo;m working as a Machine Learning Engineer focused on NLP. While I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how long would I stay, I will start by exploring this field.\nI hope to revisit this again. :)\nHappy learning :)\n","date":"2024-05-31","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/learning-strategy/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Learning Hasn't Been The Same","type":"blog"},{"content":"What are some problems I find interesting for now as an engineer without much experiences?\nHow do search engine works, how to searching and retrieval works so well in modern app. For instance, Spotify where you type can type in artists, songs, albums or anything, Notion Raindrop are more text-based, LinkedIn where you can type in people, posts, jobs (Altho in reality the search lowkey sucks actually). It makes we wonder if today I rollout an app that contains a lot tables/data managements, or a UI-heavy product like VSCode and CapCut how can I make a universal search bar that is great? It feels so great as a user, you spend minimal effort to type, and the system knows that you really want. And today, multimodality is the new engine for searches encompassing images, videos, audios, ie gallery, obsidian pkms with images and videos.\nHow do big companies serve their network across different continents? Cloud infra goes burrr, how do you make it scalable yet having a central platform to monitor infrastructures? Afterall, I still think SRE is a very interesting role to take on, and I do know it takes a lot experiences, not only building product but desining data infra, which most of the time building product is small part of keeping a organization marching steadily in the long run. System design and data infra is interesting. I think the reason is that what I felt as a software engineer working on product, DevOps engineers are like magician they do every stuff behind the scene. Part of the reason is that I might not be the most effective builder or your typical 10x engineers, maybe I can find my sense helping my fellow engineers to build faster, have the platform to see metrics they care, have the freedom to provision infra they need.\nHow can I help art creators? I love arts, I suck at arts, but I know people who create good arts. What problems do they have? How can I help them? I think the specturm covers photographer, graphic designers, music composer, etc.\nWhat types of companies I would love to work with?\nIdk, working with the cinematography industry anc creative industry sounds so great. I love imagination. I love daydreaming.\nCompanies like Weight and Biases, Duolinguo, Riot Games, Blizzard and of course Spotify.\nI feel like I like to work with it more if I encounter problems with it in my real life, else I don\u0026rsquo;t even care. For example, I don\u0026rsquo;t care enough about fintech products to be honest.\nOne more thing I should take note of is, how can I stand out as a condidate so I can work on these problems? What is unique in me as a engineer?\nNo real answer, but I think is the ability to design robust data infra and system. Hence I think SRE and DE skills (Data Tool Stacks) are pretty important. Welp of course, scaling enough AI resources for training and inferencing is also under the umbrella.\nThese are the fantasy \u0026ldquo;what company I want to work for\u0026rdquo;. Does it really has alot things to do with AI now, when I think about it? Well I have to admit AI tech are just supplementary technologies in solving the core business problems. I do believe AI has much and much application for individual productivity. What I think about individual productivity is about three things:\nhelp us to remember better retrieval and recall of contents reduce jobs we know is repetitive, and not so meaningful.

There were a lot of different answers when I tried to look up people\u0026rsquo;s answer on Reddit and Quora. The most common answer I see is that people sees internet as a huge library and source of knowledge they can soak up. It is a source of information.\nTo me, I always see internet as a new world and a different physical space, that people turn into a different version of themself. That\u0026rsquo;s how people are using internet nowadays, which I\u0026rsquo;m not denying its value, nor I\u0026rsquo;m saying it\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, but is that the true value of the internet?\nWhen I rethink about it, to me, internet space supposed to be no different from what we do and who we are in real life. The point of internet is just to connect. It\u0026rsquo;s a medium that helps us share our daily stories, spontaneous ideas or just any interesting thoughts we have with people that we want to share with. It is simply our daily social network that happens to surpass the physical time-space constraint.\nComing around this, I would also say, the true value of internet are realized only when we start focus around its true value, and start building platforms that can connect people.

To be honest, do I really want to achieve it? Do I have such yearn only because it sounds cool, or only to satisfy the vanity in my own imaginary world?\nA good question to ask to validate is:\nIf you have tons of money and were just told to enjoy the rest of your life, would you still gonna hustle and to achieve the career goal you set?\nNgl. That hit me hard.\nI guess I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work that hard, but there\u0026rsquo;s one thing for sure, I would still have the raw and pure curiosity, over all the things in the world that feels so magical to me.
