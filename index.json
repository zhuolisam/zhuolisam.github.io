Growing up, I learned Latin. I was never that good at it, but I was always kind of into that sort of stuff. Read a lot about the Roman Empire and things.\u0026rsquo;\nAfter bookmarking it, I pushed it to the back of my mind. But during my evening stroll, while reflecting on some pain points that I\u0026rsquo;m facing, I get new ideas and inspirations from Luke\u0026rsquo;s story.\nThere are many branches and topics in CS, sparked huge curiosity in me, and I want to learn tiny bit of them as much as I could. Distributed system, concurrent programming, NLP, LLMs, and recently AI Agents, are some examples.\nAs I delved deeper studying them, I’d eventually find myself going in circles, not learning anything concrete. I spent some time reading about AI agents, yet when I tried to build one, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know what should I build. The excitement of learning fizzled into frustration.\nTurns out maybe curiosity alone isn’t enough. It seems it needs something to complement it.\nI asked, is there something that this technology can connect to me? Like how they connect to Luke\u0026rsquo;s childhood interests? Maybe it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to connect to my interest, but other past experiences that I have.\nI did find some answers.\nLuke\u0026rsquo;s story brought up a new mindset. Learning something because it looks cool is a fine starting point, to learn and work on something because it connects with a part of me is much more powerful.\nI talked about it to ChatGPTand got roasted. The idea that learning is more meaningful when it connects to personal experiences, is obvious. It\u0026rsquo;s a realization that should happened years ago. but I had to learn it after I really face my frustrations that have been around for years.\nThen, can we manufacture connection rather than waiting for a link to appear? Or to force a weak and a far-fetched connection to draw motivation? I have no clue.\nPS.\nA small note, Luke also mentioned his education contributed to his achievement.\n\u0026lsquo;The University of Nebraska does a really good job of encouraging their students to think boldly.

Even with that, I still have a very clear sense of how technology fits in the big picture, and which exact fraction of technology I should learn.\nTo help contribute to company success. To help my team and company grow, I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on learning things that would bring real impact. It means seeking better solution, help speeding up existing workflow, improving team productivity, scaling services and ensuring services uptime, saving cost, .etc.\nFor example:\nHow to write cleaner and more maintainable code? Can the latest open source library X improve our current solution? How can I identify opportunities to save infrastructure cost? What is a good enough strategy to scale services to handle users traffic efficiently? How can I scale team productivity? The fundamentals of software engineering and those questions that get asked during are important, but I find these questions much more interesting and fulfiling. They keep my curiosity and the drive to learn alive.\nLastly, explore for fun! I often feel excited. I find myself constantly drawn to cool tech facts and breakthroughs. It\u0026rsquo;s so crazy to think learn about the fact there\u0026rsquo;s so much things that weren\u0026rsquo;t available 10 years ago that are available today. Computers helped change our lives so much.\nThey usually comes in form of news and facts, and I find myself drawn to these random facts, start researching, digging and learning bottom up about the concepts related to the fact.\nFor instance: The largest known prime number is over 16 million digits long was found October 2024, which the underlying compute power were a large distributed GPUs network crowdsourced by spanning 17 countries. That makes me wonder how does it work, and I drill down the rabbit hole.\nBy wearing a purpose lens, I\u0026rsquo;ve found direction in the vast world of tech.

I thought that by filling all of my available time on work, results will yield.\nI was wrong.\nFrom the math perspective, the formula of productivity is simply result over time.\n$$ Productivity = \\frac{Result}{Time} $$\nTo increase Productivity in the formula, we have to be able to measure by controlling the variables. The first step to measure Productivity, is to limit the time spent. At work, at tasks, at projects.\nThere\u0026rsquo;ll never be an end to all the tasks we have at work, the projects we wanted to complete. I always have so many projects idea in my mind, but I never get them done, nor I ever feel productive when I finally start to work on them. The project features gets bigger in head, until the motivation depletes.\nTurns out the first step to completing more is simple: set a deadline.\nThis aligns with the statement in Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s law.\nWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion\nBy limiting time, we remove unnecessary work and distractions getting in our way from completing a project before the deadline. For me, that includes overthinking and bloating the target outcome in the project.\nEvery effort counts. No matter how small, whatever experimental knowledge, novel insights, practical experiences we gained in previous work turns into foundation ready to be transferred into use in our next project. We incrementally raise the target outcome in next iteration, pushing what we able to product and achieve in the next project, bits by bits. That\u0026rsquo;s how productivity increases. Incremental result produced within the same timeframe.\nAnother way I look at increasing productivity in the formula, is to get a focused and small scoped result under increasingly shorter time. I think this applies when we\u0026rsquo;re at a context familiarising ourselves in particular environment, crafting a precise actions skill, or to consolidate and retain existing knowledge chunks.\nI realized this simple perspective but have yet to complete any significant projects.

The richness of diversity of life is what makes the world so beautiful. Think about it: Everyone\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, behaviours, feelings, beliefs are inherently unique.

All three movements carry such pure emotion that they can draw out the kindness in any person. The second movement is especially well-known; you probably hear it elsewhere. I have listened to them repeatedly throughout the entire month. While walking home from work and feeling bored, I began to imagine and visualize the story behind the second movement, picturing the scene Rachmaninoff was depicting in my mind. I swear, visualizing the story of a piece is the most fun part about classical music.\nSo here is what I heard:\nLong ago, one afternoon, there were two lovers who fell in love at first sight. They were happily dating each other, walking down a river. One day, they had to separate for some reason, and it would be a very long time before they can meet again. The man faced a significant setback, and they couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet with each other. They promised to meet at the place where they first fell in love, after ten years later.\nMany years passed, and both endured numerous hardships, but the time has finally come. They know each other will keep the promise. The day has come, they promise to meet at the bridge they first met. The place were crowded, and they desperately searched for each other through the throng. The woman glimpsed the man but lost sight of him in the sea of people. She pushed her way through the crowd, almost stumbling. As she emerged from the throng, her eyes locked with his. A second felt like a hundred years.\nThey met, but both knew it was a brief reunion. After many years, they had their own stables lives now. The man had to leave before sunset. They hoped time would freeze at that moment, and they can look at each other for longer, for hundred years, for eternity.\nInterestingly, the image I envisioned resembled the final scene of the film Brief Encounter, where the characters break up and part ways. In fact the second movement was chosen as the background music ( Here\u0026rsquo;s a YouTube video of it). This would probably be the story of the two lovers. Unlike Rach\u0026rsquo;s Piano Concerto No.3, this piece has some magical quality that irresistibly draws you in.

There were a lot of different answers when I tried to look up people\u0026rsquo;s answer on Reddit and Quora. The most common answer I see is that people sees internet as a huge library and source of knowledge they can soak up. It is a source of information.\nTo me, I always see internet as a new world and a different physical space, that people turn into a different version of themself. That\u0026rsquo;s how people are using internet nowadays, which I\u0026rsquo;m not denying its value, nor I\u0026rsquo;m saying it\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, but is that the true value of the internet?\nWhen I rethink about it, to me, internet space supposed to be no different from what we do and who we are in real life. The point of internet is just to connect. It\u0026rsquo;s a medium that helps us share our daily stories, spontaneous ideas or just any interesting thoughts we have with people that we want to share with. It is simply our daily social network that happens to surpass the physical time-space constraint.\nComing around this, I would also say, the true value of internet are realized only when we start focus around its true value, and start building platforms that can connect people. At least for me.\n","date":"2024-05-18","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/what-does-the-internet-mean-to-me/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"What Does The Internet Mean To Me?","type":"blog"},{"content":"My golden dream when I was in highschool, was to hustle hard, get a work in a leading tech/eng organization, like Boeing or Airbus, working on one-of-a-kind problem, designing new cutting-edge solutions that would change the world and push humanity\u0026rsquo;s technology forward.\nBut why would I have such dream? To be honest, do I really want to achieve it? Do I have such yearn only because it sounds cool, or only to satisfy the vanity in my own imaginary world?\nA good question to ask to validate is:\nIf you have tons of money and were just told to enjoy the rest of your life, would you still gonna hustle and to achieve the career goal you set?\nNgl. That hit me hard.\nI guess I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work that hard, but there\u0026rsquo;s one thing for sure, I would still have the raw and pure curiosity, over all the things in the world that feels so magical to me. How tf did the rockets able to fly to the moon? How did the engineers design better aircrafts wings? How did we launched a satelite that is capable of taking a picture of the black hole? Humanity\u0026rsquo;s technology is just so fascinating. I want to know. Knowing how things works fixes my thirst.\nI definitely understand things that I currently care, is because I have experienced it myself. They somehow excite and trigger the curiosity in me. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if I would start to be interested in other things in the future. Someone could share some piece of random piece of knowledge and I would start jumping down the rabbit hole. In fact, large portion of my interest in CS is inspired by amazing friends around me, things like Linux and Computer Networking, their existence just left me feel fascinated.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a toxic trait in me. Once I know how a thing work, I never bother building or creating a solution out of it. It\u0026rsquo;s strange I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in solving unsolved problem, I\u0026rsquo;m just curious how current things work. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s just how I am.\nBut if one is really thirsty, move on, being curious is not enough. Stop trying to understand it and really understand it. The best way to understand it is to build it.\n","date":"2024-05-17","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/what-drives-me-in-life/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"What Drives Me in Life?","type":"blog"},{"content":"I consider myself to be lucky I\u0026rsquo;m who I\u0026rsquo;m today. I was lucky to have parents who provided me considerable good amount of exposure to a lot of things. Music, I was picked up violin since I was young. Even I don\u0026rsquo;t play it nowadays, I learn to appreciate these music pieces beautifully crafted by our ancestors 200. Books. My dad reads a lot of books, and we have a big shelf of books, the ones I enjoyed the most back I was a kid, was the dinasour encyclopedia that has a lot of realistic graphics. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to receive pretty good education, there were good teachers who sparked my interest in physics and mathematics. I enjoyed the physics lab a lot. Interest. I\u0026rsquo;m lucky to have an awesome childhood friend, who argubably is the one who sparked a lot of my today\u0026rsquo;s interest and person who affected me the most. We watched animes, we watched gundams, we build gunplas, we exchanged drawings, we played PS2 games, we built Legos, everything together. He got me into anime, science, space, structure, curiousity, creative works. I were once a really creative person back then, even I sucked at drawings class, I liked structures a lot.\nAs time goes by, I grow older and parted with my friends, I started to lose sense of what I really enjoyed deep down in my heart. I really liked physics engineering that I was supposed to study aeronatics, but I ended up studying computer science, when the pandemic hits, that makes me realize CS is probably a better way out. I really appreciate studying CS, and I never regretted it. It opens up a whole new perspetive for me of viewing the world, and how techs has no limits and how it significantly improved human\u0026rsquo;s lives.\nI\u0026rsquo;m lucky that I have a pretty good brain and I can memorize, reason, excels at academic. But overall these years, it seemed that I have limited experiences dealing with failure, and my only mechanism to deal with it is to avoid it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;re so many things that I have experiences, some natural instinct that I was born with, and the things that I have learnt during my uni years, but they\u0026rsquo;re here and there and they never really get connected in my brain, nor are they connected them with the coding skills I have. I want to really live out my life. I want to know where are my boundaries. I want to know how would I look like if I maxed out myself, in pursuing the things I\u0026rsquo;m curious.\nStarting today, I want to connect thougths, ideas, interest in my brain, by realizing them through the medium I have. I loved music and arts so much, I enjoyed crafting concrete artworks, I was so curious about how the universe works, I was so hyped about sci-fi world. I want to find the child in me, who\u0026rsquo;s curious, creative, fearless, I want to be the person again.\n","date":"2024-05-16","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/reflection/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"A Checkpoint Reflection","type":"blog"},{"content":" Now page changes with time and priorities.
